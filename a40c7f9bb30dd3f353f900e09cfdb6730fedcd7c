      "message": "You can have multiple factories here, where each factory will do some specific operation, then you can return one object for each factory. Each factory can have a logical boundary. You can call those factories at required controller or other factories. \n\nThis way code becomes easier to read. I know you have mentioned that you will move away from jquery ajax calls, you can use $http or Restangular, which is very nice, less verbose and easy to use",
